We used a mixed-methods approach to determine what Rust developers cite as their motivations for using \unsafe code and how they reason about its soundness.  We conducted semi-structured interviews with \ArrayItem{responses.screening.valid} Rust developers and used our findings to create a survey that received \ArrayItem{responses.survey.valid} valid responses. We found that developers typically use \unsafe code when they perceive that there is no safe alternative, and they attempt to minimize, localize, and encapsulate it whenever possible. However, reliance on trust and ad-hoc reasoning left developers uncertain if their designs were sound. To resolve this safety gap, developers who engage with \unsafe code need to make automated validation an essential component of their workflow, and tool developers must continue to add robust support for \unsafe features.
